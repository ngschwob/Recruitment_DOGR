- Changing how you manipulate objects, not only on the immediate demands (picking it up) but also on the goal of the object use
- Planning for future actions with the object
- When grabbing a spoon to eat, the action end, or the bucket needs to be directed towards your mouth

# Spoon Task

- Thumb oriented towards the action end = Efficient Radial Grasp
- Thumb oriented away from the action end = Inefficient Ulnar Grasp

# Spoon task
- Depending on where the action end is you may need to inhibit your dominant hand to keep your thumb pointing towards the action end
- This behaviors emerges as young as 9m.o.

# Cup Task

- Classic example of 2nd Order Motor Planning is flipping a cup to fill with water
- Using an initially uncomfortable inverted grasp makes turning over the cup completable in one smooth motion
- Using a typical grasp requires additional adjustment to turn the cup over

# Cup Task
- Lengthy developmental trajectory into late adolescence 
- Requires using an initially uncomfortable posture
- Inhibiting typical / comfortable posture may be more difficult than inhibiting dominant hand

# Physical Constraints

- The more degrees of freedom a species’ dexterity allows, and the ability to make precision grips, is associated with inconsistent 2nd order motor planning
- Morphological constraints drive efficiency

# Cup Task Dex

- Low Dexterity primates are more efficient than High Dex. primates in Cup Task
- Capuchins & Chimps are inefficient while Tamarins are efficient

# Spoon / Dowel Task Dex

- Dexterity seems less important in Spoon / Dowel Task
- Capuchins are efficient here, unlike cup task
- The demands of either inhibiting a dominant hand in the spoon task and inhibiting a typical grasping posture in the cup task are leading to different planning

# Tamarins

- Spoon / Dowel task has lower constraints than cup task
- Tamarins have low dexterity & no tool use
- In Cup Task, tamarins perform better than other dexterous species
- When cost of error is lower, will tamarins continue to use efficient grips?

# Inefficient Ulnar Grasp

# Results
- 6/7 tamarins used a radial grasp more often than chance
- As a sample, the tamarins showed a preference for efficient radial grasps
  - *ß* = 8.71, *t*(34) = 4.58, *p* = .001, 95%CI [4.85, 12.58]
- No learning effect

# Summary
- Tamarins are the most morphologically constrained species that has been tested on either tasks
- Tamarins are only species so far that are efficient on cup & spoon task
- Low dexterity tamarins may use 2nd order motor planning more often than high dexterity species due to higher cost of mistakes
- Need to test more species on both tasks to explore the Morphological Constraint Hypothesis
